Features

    Blockchain implementation in Go.
    Persistence using MongoDB for data storage.
    Mining rewards for adding new blocks.
    On-chain governance system for proposing and voting on changes.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

    Go (Golang) installed on your system.
    MongoDB installed and running (or provide MongoDB connection details in the configuration).

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-app.git
cd blockchain-app

Install the required dependencies:

bash

go get github.com/globalsign/mgo
go get github.com/kataras/iris/v12

Start the application:

bash

    go run main.go

Usage

Once the application is running, you can use it to explore and interact with the blockchain. Here are some common tasks:

    View Blockchain: Access the blockchain data at http://localhost:8080/blocks.

    Add a Block: Add a new block to the blockchain by making a POST request to http://localhost:8080/addBlock with the appropriate JSON payload.

    Create a Governance Proposal: Propose changes to the blockchain using the /propose endpoint.

    Vote on a Proposal: Cast your vote on a proposal using the /vote endpoint.

Please refer to the API Endpoints section for more details on the available endpoints and request/response formats.
API Endpoints

    GET /blocks: Retrieve the current blockchain.
    POST /addBlock: Add a new block to the blockchain.
    POST /propose: Create a new governance proposal.
    POST /vote: Cast your vote on a governance proposal.

Detailed information about each endpoint and the expected request/response formats can be found in the API documentation.
Blockchain Governance

This blockchain application includes a basic on-chain governance system. Users can propose changes and vote on them. Please note that this governance system is simplified and may require further development for real-world use cases.
